# Lusternia Chat Tabs

Set of chat tabs similarly laid out to KaiUI, but using my latest version of EMCO which provides for automatic logging among other things, and not part of an all or nothing UI.

Will start on the right side, attached to the right border. Resize, move, adjust how you see fit.

## Configuration Alias

* `lct hide`
  * hides the chat tabs
* `lct show`
  * shows the chat tabs again.
* `lct save`
  * saves the configuration
* `lct load`
  * loads the configuration
* `lct font <new font name>`
  * Sets the font for the chat consoles. Will not allow you to set one which does not exist.
* `lct fontSize <new font size>`
  * Sets the font size for the chat consoles
* `lct blink <true|false>`
  * set whether it should blink
* `lct timestamp <true|false>`

* `lct blankLine`
  * set whether it should automatically add a newline to things echoed.
